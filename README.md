ðŸ¥˜ Recipe App â€” Full Stack Project
---

# ðŸ“– Overview

The **Recipe App** is a full-stack web application that displays and manages recipes name, cuisines, and related data (time, steps, ingredientss) through a clean, interactive interface. The project started as a **Vanilla JavaScript** + **Express.js** setup, but li later restructured it to use **React + Node.js (Express)** stack â€” giving it a more modular and modern architecture.

The backend now supports both **GET** and **POST** requests â€” so the next step is to implement **DELETE** functionality.

This project has been a huge learning experience in understanding how a full-stack application works â€” how the frontend, backend, and API communicate to make everything feel seamless..

# ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Frontend:

- React (Hooks, useEffect, Components)
- Chart.js for data visualization
- HTML, CSS (basic styling)
  
Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- RESTful API endpoints serving recipe and cuisine data

# ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How full-stack development works â€” connecting a React frontend with an Express backend using fetch() and REST APIs
- Managing asynchronous data fetching and rendering charts dynamically
- Using Chart.js inside React with the useRef and useEffect hooks
- Structuring a project into separate client (frontend) and server (backend) folders
- Handling API routes, JSON responses, and connecting frontend components to live backend data

---
# ðŸ”— Api Endpoints

- GET/recipes => fetch all recipes
- POST/recipes => add a new recipe
- GET/cuisine-data => fetch all cuisines and display it in the chart

---

# ðŸ”œ Next Steps

 - Add DELETE functionality
 - Improve CSS layout and make the app responsive
